# Yemen Listening Project Notes
## Call with Annie on 19 September 2023

* We won't have images for everything so we'll try to use the YLP main image and slice it up into "stamps"
* Highlighting certain stories because the "whole" thing might not be attracting that many people * how many would actually click through stories?
* "Share this story" at the top of every story detauil page to make it more appealing to share stories
* A possibility to create individual share texts for stories in both languages (fallback if a story doesn't have individual share text)
* Within two weeks have it look more like we think it's going to look
* Using the same fonts, background images for tiles
* Dataset from Annie with 10 people to try out with by end of week 18 September
* More thoughts into mobile and how to not make it overwhelming
* A way to present the content in a "map mode"?
* Some way to tag "themes" at the bottom or story etc. (/tags/love or /tags/displacement or /tags/region)
* Landing page to introduce the project / Opener modal page or something

* Fallback is to have them stand out with transform and drop shadow
* Maybe show little icons for the ones highlighted to say why they are highlighted?
* Little icons for video/audio/image/document on the tiles
* Remove stars on mobile and reduce number of stars on mobile to save computing power
* Highlighting style needs to be adjusted, ideally they should be bigger
* Highlighted ones maybe even using 2/4 fields, would that be possible?

# Yemen Listening Project Notes
## Call with Annie on 19 September 2023

* We won't have images for everything so we'll try to use the YLP main image and slice it up into "stamps"
* Highlighting certain stories because the "whole" thing might not be attracting that many people * how many would actually click through stories?
* "Share this story" at the top of every story detauil page to make it more appealing to share stories
* A possibility to create individual share texts for stories in both languages (fallback if a story doesn't have individual share text)
* Within two weeks have it look more like we think it's going to look
* Using the same fonts, background images for tiles
* Dataset from Annie with 10 people to try out with by end of week 18 September
* More thoughts into mobile and how to not make it overwhelming
* A way to present the content in a "map mode"?
* Some way to tag "themes" at the bottom or story etc. (/tags/love or /tags/displacement or /tags/region)
* Landing page to introduce the project / Opener modal page or something

## Call with Annie on 6 February 2023

* DONE Modal box in the beginning explaining the project, also add info button
* DONE Title Yemen Listening Project somewhere on the main page, maybe in top nav?
* DONE Next button additionally to Back button on entry detail page
* DONE Create bespoke logo that combines TNH with Yemen Listening Project
* DONE Video ones should take still from the video as teaser tile image
---
* Little icons for video/audio/image/document on the tiles
* Highlighting style needs to be adjusted, ideally they should be bigger
* Highlighted ones maybe even using 2/4 fields, would that be possible?
* Fallback (for highlighted stories) is to have them stand out with transform and drop shadow
* Remove stars on mobile and reduce number of stars on mobile to save computing power

## Call with Annie on 27 February 2024

### Questions
* What are we doing with "documents" such as Word/PDF attachments? Make them open in new tab/download them?
* Audios will be videos so didn't build a view for them to play in lightbox
* Content for intro slides and static pages
* SEO for grid/list views but also detail views to be done
* Optimise image sizes further (detail pages, list view)
* Highlighted entries in the list view are now spread out
* Infinite grid highlighted entries shouldn't touch each other
* Who is going to do testing?
* Family names? Do we show them?

### The big and ugly to do list
* DONE Adjust scraper to only use entries that have 'x' in Published column
* Adjust scraper to also get the tags from every entry
* Stub article to be done
* Categorising or tagging the entries? Using colour schemes for this?
* Share/meta for SEO: Title is Yemen Listening Project (and Arabic) and description: Title of story
* Detail page if 2 or fewer attachments then on left side of text, above each other
* Detail page if 3 or more attachements then keep as is now with flowing left-to-right
* Highlighted for the grid
* Alternative for "All stories"?
* Create embeddable for Spotlight on homepage? Or use Spotlight for individual stories?
